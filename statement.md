# Problem Statement
Students often struggle to manage time, keep track of deadlines, and stay focused during study or work. Traditional to-do lists lack reminders, priority tracking, or focus timers. This project solves these issues by creating a simple task manager with Pomodoro functionality and CSV export.

# Scope
The application allows users to create, edit, delete, search, and sort tasks. It calculates task priority automatically based on due dates. Users can start Pomodoro sessions linked to tasks, and all data is stored locally in JSON format.

# Objectives
- Provide a simple and usable task management interface  
- Automatically calculate task priority (High/Medium/Low)  
- Allow Pomodoro focus sessions with logging  
- Store all data persistently using JSON files  
- Enable CSV export to reuse data
